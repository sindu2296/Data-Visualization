This prayer shawl is the ideal choice for temples, synagogues, and congregations, or anyone seeking a great quality tallit for an economical price. The blessing on the neckband is in Hebrew. Here's the translation in English: Blessed are You, our G-d, the King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with his commandments, and commanded us to wrap ourselves in the tallit."

            "Kidorable Red Fireman Rubber Rain Boots are available in childrens sizes 5-13, plus young adult sizes 1 and 2. Like all Kidorable boots, they have a fun, comfy cotton lining and custom non-slip sole. To complete the outfit, get a matching Kidorable Fireman umbrella, coat, backpack, knitwear and more! Most Kidorable products are designed for children aged 2-6. Many of our products are available for babies, and children as old as 11. Kidorable delights both children and the adults who love them by transforming everyday, functional kids' accessories into objects that excite their imaginations and enrich their lives at play. Find the gear your kids will actually beg to wear. Raincoats, Rain Boots, Umbrellas, Backpacks, Hooded Towels, Hanger Sets, Knit Gloves, Hats, and Scarves, and more. Here youll find styles to spark any kids imaginationShark, Dinosaur, Lucky Cat, Ladybug, Butterfly, Frog, and Lotus for animal and nature lovers. Pirate, Fairy, Mermaid, Ballerina, Fireman, Space Hero, Dragon Knight and Fireman for kids who dream big. Plus Dora the Explorer and SpongeBob SquarePants for kids who want to be their favorite characters. We believe in the power of imagination to make everyday families happier. Because a lot is at stake. More and more, children are forgetting how to create, to think, to explore, to connect. Over-scheduled, under-engaged, dulled by TV and video games, our kids are less and less able to amuse themselves, solve their own problems, or tell the difference between the character in the movie and the one trying to sell them cereal on TV. It's time someone said there's a better way. Someone like us. Someone like you. It's time that children and the adults who love them rely more on human beings for connection and guidance and entertainment instead of screens with shiny lights and buttons. It's easy. All it takes is someone who cares. And a little imagination. Won't you join us?",
            "How precious will your little man look in Kidorable's Fireman rainboot? Though its sturdy and made for tromping around in wet weather, he will always want to wear this playful boot with its bold flame design and printed wheels that will make his feet look like little fire engines."

            "Made of soothingly soft KbT, GOTS, IVN Best Certified Organic Merino Wool. Fits snugly to protect from wind and cold, yet slips easily on and off over head. Natural fibers breathe for comfort in warmth or cold. Untreated organic wool can absorb up to 40% of its own weight in moisture before feeling damp. And wool continues to give warmth even when it feels wet, unlike other textiles.  As wool absorbs moisture, lanolin cleanses away bacteria and odors, minimizing need for washing.  Many woolen items are treated with chemicals to make them machine-washable. No such chemicals are used on the wool which LANACare products are made of. Best care is to hand-wash occasionally in lanolin-replenishing soap to maintain wool's natural self-cleansing properties.  Formerly produced in Denmark, now made in the European Union country of Lithuania."

And we can't deny, even as adults, we are in love with the new addition to the Lego family. This fully functional alarm clock is built to resemble the Ninjago character Cole. It is equipped with an easy to read digital display with 12/24 hour format on an LCD screen for even the youngest of time-tellers, and a backlight function is included for ease of use at night. The fantastic addition to the Lego series features an alarm mode with snooze (in case you would like to reminisce in Legoland memories just a little longer.)",

A circular case surrounds a bright blue dial, complete with iconic Lego logo and a brick above six o'clock. Luminous hands and Arabic numerals make it a snap to read the time, and an eye-catching bracelet, comprised of interlocking pieces in a variety of colors, completes the eclectic, youthful look. Boasting the reliability of Japanese quartz movement, this distinctive timepiece arrives in a yellow presentation box and comes with additional bracelet pieces for quick change-outs or replacements."

It's a very practical solution for environments where an easy on/easy off shoe is appropriate. The thin rubber sole is similar to the one used on the Rikio Fighter or Rikio Ansen to provide for a comfortable and balance-oriented barefoot feel. The toe protection is a desirable feature for many situations: training, unbeaten paths, large crowds, stampedes, etc.\n\nThe external material is black 100% cotton with a thin flexible natural rubber outsole. The velcro closures offer a tight, reliable, and adjustable fit for a variety of foot widths."

            "Fringe tassels are always popular and our Tassel Keyring is no exception. Made with genuine leather, it has a round top with 2 layers of fringe hanging down below. It's attached to a dog clip style keyring so you can simply push a lever and add your keys or other keyrings to it. It's festive, fun, and easy to use - it's the perfect keychain! The Nudo collection is made of Italian Vachetta leather. This buttery smooth leather features a stiff body and a naked finish. Our Nudo leather will subtly change color with use as it is exposed to light and oil, developing a beautiful patina that is full of character. Please note, this collection is susceptible to staining, and should be treated with care."

Most Kidorable products are designed for children aged 2-6. Many of our products are available for babies, and children as old as 11. Kidorable delights both children and the adults who love them by transforming everyday, functional kids' accessories into objects that excite their imaginations and enrich their lives at play. Find the gear your kids will actually beg to wear. Raincoats, Rain Boots, Umbrellas, Backpacks, Hooded Towels, Hanger Sets, Knit Gloves, Hats, and Scarves, and more. Here youll find styles to spark any kids imaginationShark, Dinosaur, Lucky Cat, Ladybug, Butterfly, Frog, and Lotus for animal and nature lovers. Pirate, Fairy, Mermaid, Ballerina, Fireman, Space Hero, Dragon Knight and Fireman for kids who dream big. Plus Dora the Explorer and SpongeBob SquarePants for kids who want to be their favorite characters. We believe in the power of imagination to make everyday families happier. Because a lot is at stake. More and more, children are forgetting how to create, to think, to explore, to connect. Over-scheduled, under-engaged, dulled by TV and video games, our kids are less and less able to amuse themselves, solve their own problems, or tell the difference between the character in the movie and the one trying to sell them cereal on TV. It's time someone said there's a better way. Someone like us. Someone like you. It's time that children and the adults who love them rely more on human beings for connection and guidance and entertainment instead of screens with shiny lights and buttons. It's easy. All it takes is someone who cares. And a little imagination. Won't you join us?"

Heavy duty snap closure is extra strong to withstand day to day activity and washing. A snug fit against the body keeps undergarments from sagging, even when full. Narrow arm holes and snap closure at crotch make it difficult for wearers with resistant behaviors, potentially due to medical conditions such as Alzheimer's or Autism, from being able to pick at or remove undergarments. 100% cotton material is soft, comfortable, and does not irritate bare skin. As this product is 100% cotton, shrinkage of up to 10% may occur when first washed. Additionally, it is recommended to wash separately at lukewarm temperature before first use as colors may bleed on first wash."

EVEN BETTER THAN PICTURES IN PERSON! >>> SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON The best known form of the legend of St. George and the Dragon is that made popular by the \"Legenda Aurea\", and translated into English by Caxton. According to this, a terrible dragon had ravaged all the country round a city of Libya, called Selena, making its lair in a marshy swamp. Its breath caused pestilence whenever it approached the town, so the people gave the monster two sheep every day to satisfy its hunger, but, when the sheep failed, a human victim was necessary and lots were drawn to determine the victim. On one occasion the lot fell to the king's little daughter. The king offered all his wealth to purchase a substitute, but the people had pledged themselves that no substitutes should be allowed, and so the maiden, dressed as a bride, was led to the marsh. There St. George chanced to ride by, and asked the maiden what she did, but she bade him leave her lest he also might perish. The good knight stayed, however, and, when the dragon appeared, St. George, making the sign of the cross, bravely attacked it and transfixed it with his lance."

In the process of filling a niche in the watchmaking world, Swatch watches for men, women, and children innovated and revived the Swiss watch industry.

Our Heavy NATO straps are made with a durable nylon material giving a tough look, but not at the expense of comfort. Strap thickness is approximately 1.5mm. Length is approximately 270mm. Although these are much more thick than our Classic NATO straps, they still maintain the comfortable feeling expected with a NATO strap. Not only is this constructed with heat-sealed ends, but also is made with stitched lining for an extra layer of protection. This is a perfect companion product for the larger watch.

            "Beads are among the earliest human ornaments and ostrich shell beads in Africa date to 10,000 BC.Over the centuries various cultures have made beads from a variety of materials from stone and shells to clay.\nThe English word bead derives from the Old English noun bede which means a prayer. The exact origins of prayer beads remain uncertain, but their earliest use probably traces to Hindu prayers in India. Buddhism probably borrowed the concept from Hinduism. The statute of a holy Hindu man with beads dates to the 3rd century BC.\nAlthough the use of prayer beads grew within those religions, it did not enter Judaism, perhaps because of its association with other religions, and to date Judaism does not use prayer beads. Although not used as counting device, many Jews touch the knots on the tzitzits attached to their tallit (prayer shawl) at specific points in their prayers."

The boots are fastened with adjustable straps, to keep the boots tight, preventing any fallout or debris from slipping in. The toes of the shoes are capped with a steel cap, making this boot perfect for those who work in fields that require steel-toe shoes. These boots can be used for work and other environments, like survival games or hunting. To get the right size, measure both feet (they're not always the same!) from the heel to the tip of the big toe. Drawing an outline on a sheet of paper is one good way to do this. Rounded up to the nearest half centimeter is the size you should order (eg. if your feet is 23.8cm please order 24.0cm, if your feet is 24.2 cm also order 24 cm; but if your feet is 24.4 or 24.6 please order 24.5 cm; and if your feet is 24.8 cm or 25.2 cm go for 25 cm)"

The two magnet closures are ideal for people that cannot close and open triggers easily or prefer a simple opening/closure. The magnets split in half and on one end of one side of the magnet is a jump ring that you attach to the trigger of the chain you wish to add it on to, the other half has a bolt ring which you add to the jump ring of the same chain and you have a magnetic and easy opening and closing system. The two magnet closures are covered in clear stones, one is shaped in a circle and the other in the shape of a heart. This is the ideal gift."

            "According to The American Cancer Society, over 290,000 women, and more than 2,300 men, are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and more than 40,000 die from breast cancer. More than 3 million women in the United States have had, or currently have, breast cancer. These statistics mean that women have a 1 in 8 chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. Show your support for women with breast cancer with this beautiful breast cancer awareness bracelet. Made with pink cats eye beads and silver plated Bali Daisy Spacers, it also includes a cancer awareness ribbon. Great for use in cancer education campaigns, fundraisers, pink out days, or other cancer awareness events. Breast Cancer Awareness Campaigns are designed to give women the information they need to make lifestyle changes that will reduce their risk of breast cancer, and show them how to check themselves for lumps, or changes, in their breasts. Information to distribute at your Breast Cancer Awareness Event, or company Pink Out Day, include: How to conduct a good self breast exam monthly; what changes to look for and when to see a doctor. Mammograms after age 40 also help detect breast cancer in the early stages. When planning your Breast Cancer Awareness event or Pink Out Day, reach out to your local health care providers. They have a tremendous amount of helpful information to share and may be willing to attend your event or provide breast cancer awareness information or breast cancer awareness products or items that you can give to your event guests. Information about ways to reduce the risk of breast cancer is also something you will want to share with your even guests. Risk of breast cancer is greater with obesity, hormone exposure, and alcohol consumption. Breast cancer risk can be lowered by maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet high in fruits and vegetable, getting plenty of physical activity, and minimizing alcohol consumption. Join the fight against cancer. Together we can win!"

            "This is a Heavy NATO watch strap offered in 5-ring Brushed Steel for secure attachment to the wrist. Our Heavy NATO straps are made with a durable nylon material giving a tough look, but not at the expense of comfort. Strap thickness is approximately 1.5mm. Length is approximately 270mm. Although these are much more thick than our Classic NATO straps, they still maintain the comfortable feeling expected with a NATO strap. Not only is this constructed with heat-sealed ends, but also is made with stitched lining for an extra layer of protection. This is a perfect companion product for the larger watch. Questions - if you have any questions at all, please feel free to contact us at any time. Sizing - If you need help with sizing, please contact us and we are more then happy to help you!"

            "Are you looking for a kilt as a way to celebrate your Scottish ancestry? Or maybe youre simply interested in expanding your everyday wardrobe. Either way, this standard utility kilt will not disappoint. Its designed to be easy for kilt beginners but will work great on anyone regardless of their Scottish clothing experience. All our kilts are heavy-duty and will look great for any occasion. Whether you wear it casually or pair it with a sporran and belt, youre sure to stand out. Here at UT Kilts, we want you to choose the best-fitting kilt possible. Do NOT guess your size or order your jean size. Using a cloth measuring tape, measure around your waist where you think your kilt will sit. Order the size you measure. If you are in between sizes, we recommend going up a size. Your kilt will typically be around 2 sizes bigger than your jean size. This kilt is made with quality poly-cotton material. Our utility kilts have side cargo pockets and brass studs. Anyone can enjoy the simple yet rugged design of a modern kilt uniform. It has large pockets and pleats that are sewn down, so you always get that perfect Highland look. Our utility kilt has two sets of metal snap fasteners to make sure you have a solid, comfortable fit. Each one of our utility kilts for sale at UT Kilt has been designed with the active kilt wearer in mind."

Little did they know, the tiny crystals that they discovered would move on to become a popular synthetic gemstone. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Cubic Zirconia was first used in the jewelry world, when scientists began growing the crystals in the laboratory. In the 1980s, Cubic Zirconia use in jewelry continued to grow and today is it one of the most popular diamond substitutes available on the market.",
            "Composition",
            "Cubic Zirconia is the cubic form of zirconium oxide that is created in a laboratory. Its durable material allows the synthetic stone to be molded into a variety of shapes. The stone offers brilliant shine and flawless clarity. Cubic Zirconia is available in a wide range of colors, including a colorless form that is an economically important competitor to natural diamonds.",
            "Caring For Your Cubic Zirconia Jewelry",
            "Like natural diamonds, Cubic Zirconia needs to be cared for in order to maintain its original brilliance and shine. Clean with warm-to-hot water and a soft brush with a mild soap, then immediately dry with a clean cloth after rinsing. Avoid contact with perfume, body lotion, hairspray or any other chemical that may harm the shine of the stone."

The cardigan design ensures that ScratchSleeves are easy to put on and stay firmly in place without the need for fiddly fastening, which can also be used for scratching. Loose fitting sleeves ensure that babies stay cool and sensitive skin on hands and arms is not irritated.",
            "Originally designed for babies and kids with eczema, ScratchSleeves are also effective for all sorts of scratching and irritation including chicken pox, cradle cap, ear pulling, overly enthusiastic thumb sucking, nail-biting and even hair pulling.",

            "Forget every negative notion you've ever had about knit pants. Because these are knit pants the way they ought to be done. Yes, they're as comfy as leisure-wear, BUT they have the polish to go anywhere you do. To the office. Out to dinner. On casual outings and even dressier occasions. What makes them so superior? First, there's the fit. We agonized over every inch until we perfected the flat-lying wide waistband and flattering straight-leg cut. And then there's the fabric – a refined French terry that's substantial without feeling the least bit bulky. Pima organic cotton makes it deliciously soft, and spandex adds resilience so the knees won't bag and the bottom won't sag. And here's one more thing to love: They're crafted in a grassroots fair trade cooperative where justly paid workers take pride in making beautiful garments for you.

A traditional style of solid white 14k white gold metal, this ring has 58.5 percent pure gold based on its total weight. We have a 14K stamp inside the ring. This ring was rhodium plated for a brighter white luster. Rhodium plating is a common practice in gold jewelry to hide the natural light yellow color of white gold. Rhodium plating can wear off in time and will uncover the light yellowish color of white gold. Manufactured in the U.S.A. Manufactured using the die struck process for better durability and minimal porosity. The metal weight may vary by as much as one gram since these rings are handmade. This ring can be resized up to a half size bigger by a professional jeweler, but fees may apply. Be aware that any third party modification will void our warranty. The actual color of the product may vary from what is shown on your phone, tablet or computer. The weight of the ring varies depending on the size, let us know the size and we will tell you the weight. Don't be fooled, cheap gold rings that are hollow inside, they may look the same but are not durable and very light. This ring has twice the weight of hollow rings, better value for its gold weight. If you are not sure of your size? a ring size gauge is available upon request. You also have the option to engrave this ring, after placing the order send an email using the ASK A PRODUCT QUESTION button on the orders page, tell us the message and the engraving font (Arial or Script).

Although these are much more thick than our Classic NATO straps, they still maintain the comfortable feeling expected with a NATO strap. Not only is this constructed with heat-sealed ends, but also is made with stitched lining for an extra layer of protection. This is a perfect companion product for the larger watch.

            "Sometimes traveling can be stressful, and anything can happen. Well, be ahead of the game and know your money is safely guarded with this black or brown leather money belt. Made from full grain cowhide to assure a long lasting travel accessory, interchangeable buckle to add whatever belt accessories you please, and a 19.5'' YKK zipper pocket that can easily store emergency funds and a copy of your passport. This is one of the travel accessories you dont want to forget on your trip. **Double check sizing chart!! - Typically one and sometimes two sizes larger than pant size** - Size is based on the circumference of your waist. If youre actual waist measurement (NOT PANT SIZE!!) measures 36 inches then a size 36 is a good fit. Therefor size corresponds to the distance from the end of the buckle prong to the third hole of the belt measured in inches. BROWN LEATHER NOTE: No two of these belts are going to be exactly the same in leather consistency. As you can see in the picture there inconsistent dark marks in the leather making for a unique look. Some people love it while others don't. If you are one who likes things to have an original look, then this belt is for you. The leather is also a little bit more rigid at first compared to the black belt. If you want a belt that doesn't need as much wearing in please check out our other Atitlan Leather Brown Leather Money Belt listing as the leather is a bit more pliable."

            "Thick silk weave with accents of color. Long Tie Store makes extra long ties for men who are taller or larger than average. Most standard length neckties are too short for men with larger than average frames or necks. For these men, finding a tie that falls at the right place on the shirt can be a hassle, and standard length ties may feel uncomfortable. Sometimes formal events call for a necktie, as opposed to a bow tie, so its necessary for men to find a tie that looks great and feels comfortable. For example, ties are usually worn by men at weddings, formal parties, and job interviews. Luckily, we make extra long ties so that larger than average men can feel great and look great while wearing a necktie. We have two lengths of ties available: our XL 63 inch tie and our XXL 70 inch tie for even taller men. Most traditional length ties are only 58 inches long. Our 63 inch tie is best for men who are 60 to 65 tall. Men with large necks (size 18+) should also wear extra long ties. Our 70 inch tie is best for men who are 66 or taller. Men who are 64 or taller with large necks should also wear the 70 inch tie. Also, if you like to tie larger knots in your necktie, an extra long tie may be what you need. While our ties are longer than other standard length ties, they have a traditional 3.75 inch width, so theyll look just like other ties in that respect. They are wider than skinny ties, but theyre not too wide. These ties are made from 100% pure silk, with a high-quality interlining that gives them a medium-weight feel. Silk has luxurious texture that is soft to the touch and has an eye-catching shimmer that looks fantastic in formal settings. We have a huge selection of 9 colors in this pattern to choose from, including black, silver, brown, lavender, orange, light blue, yellow, navy blue, and red."

            "During their tonsure (religious profession) Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns receive a prayer rope, with the words: Accept, O brother (sister) (name), the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17) in the everlasting Jesus prayer by which you should have the name of the A prayer rope is a loop made up of complex knots The prayer rope is part of the habit of Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns and is employed by monastics (and sometimes by others) to count the number of times one has prayed the Jesus Prayer or, occasionally, other prayers. Historically, the prayer rope would typically have 100 knots, although prayer ropes with 50 or 33 knots can also be found in use today. Hermits in their cells may have prayer ropes with as many as 300 or 500 knots in them. The prayer rope is symbolizing the flock of Christ though in modern times other materials are used also. The traditional color of the rope is black (symbolizing mourning for one's sins), with either black or colored beads. When praying, the user normally holds the prayer rope in the left hand, leaving the right hand free to make the Sign of the Cross. When not in use, the prayer rope is traditionally wrapped around the left wrist so that it continues to remind one to pray without ceasing. If this is impractical, it may be placed in the (left) pocket, but should not be hung around the neck or suspended from the belt. The reason for this is humility: one should not be ostentatious or conspicuous in displaying the prayer rope for others to see. Lord in your soul, your thoughts, and your heart, saying always: \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.\" Orthodoxy regards the prayer rope as the sword of the Spirit, because prayer which is heartfelt and inspired by the grace of the Holy Spirit is a weapon that defeats the Devil."

            "Long Tie Store makes extra long neckties for men who are taller or larger than average. Most standard length neckties are too short for men with larger than average frames or necks. For these men, finding a tie that falls at the right place on the shirt can be a hassle, and standard length ties may feel uncomfortable. Sometimes formal events call for a long dress tie, as opposed to a bow tie, so its necessary for men to find a tie that looks great and feels comfortable. For example, ties are usually worn by men at weddings, formal parties, and job interviews. Luckily, we make extra long ties so that larger than average men can feel great and look great while wearing a necktie. We have two lengths of ties available: our XL 63 inch tie and our XXL 70 inch tie for even taller men. Most traditional length ties are only 58 inches long. Our 63 inch tie is best for men who are 60 to 65 tall. Men with large necks (size 18+) should also wear extra long ties. Our 70 inch tie is best for men who are 66 or taller. Men who are 64 or taller with large necks should also wear the 70 inch tie. Also, if you like to tie larger knots in your necktie, an extra long tie may be what you need. While our ties are longer than other standard length ties, they have a traditional 3.75 inch width, so theyll look just like other ties in that respect. They are wider than skinny ties, but theyre not too wide. These ties are made from 100% pure silk, with a high-quality interlining that gives them a medium-weight feel. Silk has luxurious texture that is soft to the touch and has an eye-catching shimmer that looks fantastic in formal settings. We have a huge selection of 17 solid colors to choose from, including black, brown, burgundy, red, purple, pink, white, yellow, light blue, dark green, royal blue, fuchsia, silver, lavender, teal, navy, and bright green."

            "Houndstooth extra long tie for tall men. Long Tie Store makes extra long ties for men who are taller or larger than average. Most standard length neckties are too short for men with larger than average frames or necks. For these men, finding a tie that falls at the right place on the shirt can be a hassle, and standard length ties may feel uncomfortable. Sometimes formal events call for a necktie, as opposed to a bow tie, so its necessary for men to find a tie that looks great and feels comfortable. For example, ties are usually worn by men at weddings, formal parties, and job interviews. Luckily, we make extra long ties so that larger than average men can feel great and look great while wearing a necktie. We have two lengths of ties available: our XL 63 inch tie and our XXL 70 inch tie for even taller men. Most traditional length ties are only 58 inches long. Our 63 inch tie is best for men who are 60 to 65 tall. Men with large necks (size 18+) should also wear extra long ties. Our 70 inch tie is best for men who are 66 or taller. Men who are 64 or taller with large necks should also wear the 70 inch tie. Also, if you like to tie larger knots in your necktie, an extra long tie may be what you need. While our ties are longer than other standard length ties, they have a traditional 3.75 inch width, so theyll look just like other ties in that respect. They are wider than skinny ties, but theyre not too wide. These ties are made from 100% pure silk, with a high-quality interlining that gives them a medium-weight feel. Silk has luxurious texture that is soft to the touch and has an eye-catching shimmer that looks fantastic in formal settings. We have a huge selection of 8 colors in houndstooth pattern to choose from, including brown, green, gray, orange, purple, teal, light blue, and red."

            "Lily-of-the-Valley pieces are based on the undulating, botanical lines of the Art Nouveau era, a short 20 years, ending in 1915. It brought design innovations that weren't derived from any previous style. It stressed art and hand fabrication over precious materials and machine production. Even in it's day, it was expensive and avant garde. Art Nouveau style has remained a major influence of 20th century design. Lily-of-the-Valley symbolizes innocence, purity and abundance. A favorite flower for weddings and for honoring mothers. A dainty sculptured leaf and lily stems form the right and left earrings. Translucent green enamel is hand applied to reveal the texture of the leaf. Three lily blooms are expressed in glass pearls, one stationary at the top and two dangle. For pierced ears. Signed and copyrighted Sweet Romance USA. Shelley's comments: These Earrings have strong Art Nouveau influences in its winding stems and leaves. Botanical subjects were important in expressing the curvilinear shapes and undulating lines that defined the Art Nouveau era through 1910. The 'new art' brought design innovations that weren't derived from any previous art form or period. It stressed hand fabrication over precious metals and machined manufacturing. In its day, it was expensive and avant garde. Although it occupied less than two decades of popularity, the Nouveau aesthetic remains. This fragile bloom represents innocence, purity and abundance. The flowers are attached 'en tremblant' which heighten their great appeal."
